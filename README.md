# class-scheduling
Class scheduler built while learning PHP and MVC structure.

This uses a database managed in XAMPP to store users, classes and their details, and any planned schedules created by users.
The database consists of 3 tables, members (containing user data), schedules (containing course data), and semesterplans (containing users' saved course plans).

To log in - usernames are as seen in the database "user"#, password is protected in the database, decodes to "password"#.
